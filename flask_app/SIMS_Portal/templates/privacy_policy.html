	</ul>

	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>

	</ul>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='legal-bases'>What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
	
	<p><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></p>
	
	<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><span class='fw-bold'>Consent.</span> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
		<li><span class='fw-bold'>Legal Obligations.</span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
		<li><span class='fw-bold'>Vital Interests.</span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></p>
	
	<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
	
	<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
		<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
		<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
		<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
		<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
		<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
		<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
		<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
		<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>

		<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='share-personal'>When and with whom do we share your personal information?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
	
	<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><span class='fw-bold'>Data Transfers with other Red Cross Red Crescent services.</span> We may share or transfer your information in connection with other Red Cross Red Crescent related networks, databases, or related systems such as the GO Platform. Data will not be transferred to any non-RCRC entities without your permission.</li>
		<li><span class='fw-bold'>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</span> We may temporarily share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API) when you update your location. All API calls are made via a token that only recognizes that the traffic is coming from the site, but is not in any way associated with you either in transit or when it reaches Google's servers. When you update your location, only the point coordinates (at whatever level of specificity you select), your timezone, and a place name are stored in this site's database. To find out more about Google’s Privacy Policy, please refer to this <a href='https://policies.google.com/privacy'>link</a>. We obtain and store on your device ("cache") your location. You may revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at the end of this document.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='tracking-tech'>Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
	
	<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice. Additionally, your sessions when logged in using your username and password use unique codes to help manage your secure access, but do not function as any form of tracker once you leave the site.</p>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='keep-info'>How long do we keep your information?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
	
	<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
	
	<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. Marking your account for deletion does not immediately remove the data from the database, but does prevent anyone without admin access from seeing it. Data marked for deletion is then permanently removed from the database on a manual basis no less frequently than once per year, or sooner by request.</p>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='info-safety'>How do we keep your information safe?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
	
	<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='info-minors'>Do we collection information from minors?</h4>

	<p>Children under 18 years of age are not permitted to support the Network, and shall not be allowed to create approved accounts. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at jonathan.garro [at] redcross.org.</p>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='privacy-rights'>What are your privacy rights?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
	
	<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
	
	<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
 	
	<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact <a href='https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm'>details here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are <a href='https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html'>available here</a>.</p>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>Withdrawing your consent:</span> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
	
	<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
	
	<h5 class='Montserrat'>Account Information</h5>
	
	<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
	
	<ul>

	</ul>
	
	<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
	
	<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at jonathan.garro [at] redcross.org.</p>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='do-not-track'>Controls for Do-Not-Track features</h4>
	
	<p>The site does not include any trackers that track your activity once you navigate away from the site.</p>
	
	<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
	
	<h4 class='Montserrat text-danger my-3' id='california-residents'>Do California residents have specific privacy rights?</h4>
	
	<p><span class='fw-bold text-dark'>In Short:</span> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>
